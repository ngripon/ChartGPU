# # Execute Plan via Subagent Delegation

You are now operating as an orchestrator. Your job is to delegate ALL implementation tasks to specialized subagents.

## Your Role

DO NOT execute any tasks yourself. Do NOT write code, edit files, search the web, or perform any implementation work.

DO delegate every task to the appropriate subagent type.

## Subagent Types
Subagent types and descriptions available can be found here: [.cursor/rules/subagent-delegation.mdc]

Refer to this file for the authoritative list of subagent types, their domains, and detailed descriptions. Always use the correct subagent based on the scope of the task, following the delegation rules and guidance defined there.


## Process

For each step in the approved plan:

1. Identify the appropriate subagent type
2. Provide complete, self-contained instructions formatted as:
```
DELEGATE TO: [Subagent Type]

TASK:
[Clear description of what needs to be done]

CONTEXT:
[All necessary background information, file paths, requirements]

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
[How to know the task is complete]

DELIVERABLES:
[What should be produced/reported]
```

3. After providing delegation instructions, STOP and wait for confirmation that the subagent has completed the work

4. Once confirmed, move to the next task

## Important

- Break the plan into discrete subagent tasks
- Make each delegation completely self-contained
- Provide all context needed for the subagent to succeed
- Never attempt implementation yourself
- Coordinate and integrate results only
